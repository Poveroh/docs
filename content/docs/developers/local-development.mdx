Poveroh is designed to be easy to set up and run locally. This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with local development.

Every scripts are written in JavaScript and can be run using `npm`, so the operating system does not matter. As long as you have Node.js installed, you can follow these instructions on any platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (>= 18.x)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) - to run PostgreSQL and NGIX CDN
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)
- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Run Locally

### Get start

1. Clone the project

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Poveroh/poveroh.git
    ```

2. Go to the project folder

    ```bash
    cd poveroh
    ```

3. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Copy `.env.example` file to `.env`, then edit it with the necessary values. For more details, read [docs](https://github.com/Poveroh/poveroh/blob/main/docs/ENV_SETUP.md).

    > If you don't modify them, the default values are sufficient to run the project.
    >
    > **Warning**: Since these are default values, security is not guaranteed.

### Setup Database and CDN

> Docker and Docker Compose must be installed, up, and running on the machine.

1. Run `setup` file

    ```bash
    npm run setup
    ```

    The command will execute the following steps:
    - Create and run database docker image.
    - Navigate to the `packages/prisma` directory.
    - Generate the Prisma client.
    - Apply any pending migrations to the database using Prisma.
    - Create and run CDN ngix docker image.

    > **⚠️ Warning:**  
    > If you encounter any difficulties or something doesn't go as planned, read [this file](scripts/README.md) to execute it manually.

2. Create a user; open a browser to [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up) and sign up.

3. _Optionally_, you can run the following exactly script to generate and fill database with fake data:

    ```bash
    npm run setup:data --user=<user_id_created_before>
    ```

    > You can find user ID on the [personal information page](http://localhost:3000/account/profile)

### Build and run

1. Build project

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. Run project

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
