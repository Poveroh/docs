---

Poveroh is designed to be easy to set up and run locally. This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with local development.

Every scripts are written in JavaScript and can be run using `npm`, so the operating system does not matter. As long as you have Node.js installed, you can follow these instructions on any platform.

Poveroh repository follows the [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) approach.

The development branch is `main`.

Before starting to work on a new feature or fix, create a new branch from `main` with a descriptive name. For example, if you are working on a new feature called "user authentication", you can create a branch named `feature/user-authentication`.

When you finish your work, push the branch to the remote repository and create a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (>= 18.x)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) - to run PostgreSQL and NGIX CDN
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)
- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Run Locally

### Get start

1. Clone the project

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Poveroh/poveroh.git
    ```

2. Go to the project folder

    ```bash
    cd poveroh
    ```

3. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Copy `.env.example` file to `.env`, then edit it with the necessary values. For more details, read [docs](https://github.com/Poveroh/poveroh/blob/main/docs/ENV_SETUP.md).

    > If you don't modify them, the default values are sufficient to run the project.
    >
    > **Warning**: Since these are default values, security is not guaranteed.

### Setup Database and CDN

> Docker and Docker Compose must be installed, up, and running on the machine.

1. Run `setup` file

    ```bash
    npm run setup
    ```

    The command will execute the following steps:
    - Create and run database docker image.
    - Navigate to the `packages/prisma` directory.
    - Generate the Prisma client.
    - Apply any pending migrations to the database using Prisma.
    - Create and run CDN ngix docker image.

    > **⚠️ Warning:**  
    > If you encounter any difficulties or something doesn't go as planned, read [this file](scripts/README.md) to execute it manually.

2. Create a user; open a browser to [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up) and sign up.

3. _Optionally_, you can run the following exactly script to generate and fill database with fake data:

    ```bash
    npm run setup:data --user=<user_id_created_before>
    ```

    > You can find user ID on the [personal information page](http://localhost:3000/account/profile)

### Build and run

1. Build project

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. Run project

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Debugging & Logging

To debug the project, you can use the built-in debugging tools in your IDE or editor.

If you use VSCode, you can go to the `Run and Debug` section and select one of the following options.

Remember that you must run `npm run dev` before starting the debugging session.

If you want to debug both simultaneously, you can select `Poveroh:app+api` in the `Run and Debug` section of VSCode.
This will start both the frontend and backend in debug mode, allowing you to debug both at the same time.

### Frontend

If you run comand `npm run dev`, automatically the project will be started in debug mode, so in console you can see the logs and debug information.

While coding, it is recommmended to use `logger.debug` to log debug information. In production, these logs will not be displayed, but in development mode, they will be visible in the console.
Make sure to print debug information only when necessary, as it can clutter the console and make it harder to find important logs.

If you want to debug it, you can use the browser's developer tools or if you use VSCode, you can go in the `Run and Debug` section and select `Poveroh:app`.

### Backend

In backend, logs are printed in a folder `logs` under `api` folder. Logs file are in `gitignore`, so they are not pushed to the repository.

Unlike the frontend, debug logs are not printed when running the `npm run dev` command, but only if `LOG_LEVEL` is set to `DEBUG`. Default value is `INFO`.

Like the frontend, you can attach a debugger to the backend. If you use VSCode, you can go in the `Run and Debug` section and select `Poveroh:api`.
